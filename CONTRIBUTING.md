# How to Contribute

I'm thrilled you're considering making a contribution to my project! The process is straightforward, and I've outlined the steps below.

1. **Fork the Repository**: To start, click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository page.

2. **Clone the Repository**: In your new fork, click the "Code" button and copy the URL. Then, open your terminal and run the command `git clone [URL]`.

3. **Create a New Branch**: Navigate to the project directory by running `cd [project-name]` in your terminal. Switch to the `master` branch with `git checkout master` and create a new branch by running `git checkout -b [branch-name]`.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Now's the time to contribute your changes to the project. Once you're finished, add your changes with `git add .`.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with `git commit -m "[commit-message]"`.

6. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub by running `git push origin [branch-name]`.

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Go back to your fork on GitHub, select your branch, and click "New pull request". Make sure the target branch for the pull request is `master` in the original repository.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Your effort and expertise help us continue to improve and grow.
